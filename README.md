1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure deadlines are met?
Answer: Timely delivery is critical because delays can lead to increased costs, loss of client trust, and missed market opportunities. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by:

Setting clear milestones and deadlines
Using project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello)
Regularly tracking progress with Agile sprints or Gantt charts
Identifying and mitigating risks early
2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Answer: Effective cost control ensures financial resources are used efficiently and prevents unexpected expenses. Strategies to prevent budget overruns include:

Establishing a clear budget and contingency plan
Monitoring expenses regularly
Prioritizing features based on ROI
Using cost estimation techniques (e.g., bottom-up estimating)
3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer:

Methodology	Advantages	Disadvantages
Agile	Flexibility, faster feedback, better for evolving projects	Requires high team collaboration, less structured documentation
Waterfall	Clear structure, well-documented, better for fixed requirements	Inflexible, costly to make changes, longer development time
4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Answer:

Agile: Best for dynamic projects where requirements change frequently, e.g., SaaS applications and mobile apps.
Waterfall: Ideal for projects with well-defined requirements, e.g., government systems or banking software.
5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Answer:
Methods include:

Regular code reviews
Automated and manual testing
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
User acceptance testing (UAT)
Maintaining high standards ensures software reliability, reduces technical debt, and improves user satisfaction.

6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Answer:
Defining project scope prevents scope creep and ensures alignment with business goals. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks down projects into smaller tasks, making planning and execution more manageable.
